            <div>Project Background</div>
            <p>
                The project is aimed at developing a portfolio website with pages to asses
                the author`s ability to create a web page using html and css, and also to
                manage the code using git/github.It is based on the basic concept of web
                development,coding, design and debugging process taught in the module.

            <div>Learning Experience</div>
            <p>
                I am still relatively new in programming- i was a complete novice in coding 
                prior to joining the course.It was completely a new concept to me when i started.
                In the beginning, my goal was to become familiar with the basic concepts of coding,
                the structure and design of html and css. Along the way, i gathered some hopefully-
                useful lessons.Some of them from my own experience ie pushing myself to do things,
                doing course work exercises, making mistakes, and learned from the mistakes.Some from
                asking questions and watching you tube videos. Each lesson gave me a bit-by-bit
                foundation on some part of coding then set a challenge to do something with it.I also
                realised that coding requires daily practice and study. When i was doing a bit of coding
                every, i found i could grasp some key concepts quickly. But if i stopped for a few 
                days, it was like wiping the slate clean.I had forgotten some basic stuff when 
                trying to code. Web development and coding requires deep mental involvement especially 
                when trying to understand a new concept, you will do a lot of screen staring,trying to
                visualise and understand the logic flow of the code.Very often, i would sit down to 
                learn and code something, thinking i would spend few minutes say (30mins), then get 
                stuck- two to three hours would go, i would still be struggling to figure out the solution.At 
                times it takes days to get unstuck.It is frustrating sometimes putting in the effort
                writing a few lines of code, then you run a test on it and it does not work- and then
                you start the debugging process to fix the code and it takes hours-just to find out 
                it was a small mistake (eg misplaced bracket or missing colon ) or the some parts of the 
                code is not correct.But when you finally fix the bug and things start working, there 
                is that sudden rush of pleasure that is almost unlike anything you have experienced.

             <div>Module Experience</div>
             <p>
                 Generally the module was a very challenging one owing to the fact that it was 
                 completely a new concept to me. I had to figure out the best way forward to face 
                 the challenge to try and understand the basic concept of the module. One of my lead 
                 way was to constantly pushing myself to try and do the module exercises,which of 
                 course was the base for me to understand the structure and design of html code and css.
                 Still in the learning process and more challenges ahead.

             <div>Design and Development</div>
             <p>
                 The site is developed and design using html and css programming language.The 
                 DOCTYPE html declaration (always at the beginning of the html document) 
                 informs the website`s browser that the document being rendered is an 
                 html document. Html structure and html tags were used to habour the codes and the 
                 css language  used to style and described how the html elements are  displayed.

             </p>
             <P>
                 linking the two pages together (html and css) is archieved by using the
                 link tag (link rel="stylesheet" href="example.css"), and this is done
                 in the html document.Any changes made on either of the document(html or css),
                 displays the effect on the result.The same tag style is used to create the 
                 desktop and mobile version of the page- in this case adding media= "screen
                 (max/min width: xxx px)". 

             </P>
              
             <p>
                 Designing the website was achieved using css grid and the same pattern was 
                 used across each page to provide consistency. The design decision was based
                 on the author`s level of experience and understanding at the time and also 
                 exposure to some video sites.
                 The selection of Fonts and colours required a combination of thinking and intuition, 
                 and was chosen randomly making sure it is legible and presentable.
